Android single lens depth scanner - proof of concept
Developed by Fabio Lorenzi & Marco Verzeletti - Universita Degli Studi di Brescia - Digital Image Processing course.

This project is a proof of concept of the possibility to detect depth of objects trhoughout a single lens on a low cost android device.

Based on HaarCascadeClassifier and ORB+FLANN object detector it can be trained to automatically find different objects in a landscape
and estimate their distance via triangulation method.

This project is a proof of concept, NOT bug-free.

If someone want to contribute, study or develope the project is welcome to do so.

Please feel free to issue pull request.
